Project Overview

This project involves predicting stock prices and analyzing market trends using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) techniques. The notebook (.ipynb file) is built with Python and integrates various machine learning algorithms and libraries to forecast stock prices based on historical data.
Features:

    Data Collection: Automated extraction of historical stock data using APIs (such as Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance).
    Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, normalization, and feature engineering.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding patterns within the stock data.
    Modeling: Application of machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for stock price prediction.
    Evaluation: Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and MAE score.
    Forecasting: Predicting future stock prices based on historical trends.
